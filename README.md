# Users List

## üìù About

This project is as simple as rendering a list of users returned from a provided API.

### What did I like about it?

Super easy to code.

### What I didn't like about it?

Super easy to code.

### Why didn't you choose a new framework so you could challenge yourself and make it fun?

Honestly, I thought I should do exactly what was requested with the tools I at my disposal so I didn't waste any time.

### So why did you choose NextJs?

Because I've taken a look at Colab's web app and saw that they're using it. And it is also the one I'm most used to.

### Why NextJs is great?

Because it provides a lot of tools just out of the box so you can focus on coding.

### Why haven't you created services, utils, more folders for better code organization?

Because it would be overengineering.

### What do you think could be done to expand this project and make it more exciting?

Add features like filters with multiple parameters to select different user subsets; add state management and caching so the application can keep going even when the API fails.

### And why have you written the readme and the code in English?

I think it will help to differentiate my communication skills.
